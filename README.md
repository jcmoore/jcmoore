# Welcome!

Justin C. Moore here.  In the future, you'll be able to find out all about me at [jcmoore.dev](https://jcmoore.dev) but this placeholder will have to tide you over while that site is still under construction.  Were it fully up and running, you'd be able to find the following there:

### My bio
* I am a front-end developer and more.
  * I was more formally educated in mechanical engineering and less formally educated in game development.

* I think in JavaScript, but love reading code in any language that has an implementation of a solution relevant to my interests when time permits.
  * I see code as data and am convinced that the time has come to develop richer interactive data visualizations that convey the meaning of code (just as charts and graphs were invented to uniquely express and understand tabular data).

* I pursue the design of systems that obviate or delay the need to make less important decisions so attention can be focused on more important ones.
  * I believe a strong foundation in data structures (persistent and otherwise), distributed consensus, and static analysis will be essential to realize my vision.

* I am inclined towards entrepreneurship.

### My speaking references
* I have presented about novel state-management approaches particularly useful when architecting UI design systems and other components that expect a lot of reuse.
  * The upshot is that, in response to UI events, a component can emit an "action-reducer" pair that describes how the component expects its otherwise stateful "props" to change as a result -- this allows a parent component to host child state and control it fully.
    * I use terminology from React and Redux, but the insights of the approach should be applicable to any declarative `props => UI` rendering solution (Swift UI, Jetpack Compose, and Flutter come to mind)
  * A recent draft of the slides for the talk are available online [here](https://jfinity-state-basics.netlify.app/).
* I will be speaking again at the [Chicago React Meetup in August](https://www.meetup.com/React-Chicago/events/266727379/), it should be accessible remotely for anyone interested.

### My technological pursuits
* My next focus is to adapt my state-management insights into a framework-agnostic system that incorporates first-class considerations for "functional lensing" between parent and child component "props dialects" while reducing superfluous ancestral re-rendering where possible.
  * ... there will be a blog post explaining what that all means.
  * I am taking a lot of inspiration from [@davidkpiano](https://twitter.com/davidkpiano) and the work he is doing with state charts and actors with XState.
    * I particularly appreciate the attention given to [the XState visualizer](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).
* My subsequent focus will regard the design of client and server data interactions leveraging optimistic concurrency control where possible and appropriate.
  * I am particularly interested in in the sort of distributed consensus that can be achieved by deterministic processing of strictly consistently ordered distributed logs (FoundationDB, CockroachDB, and Kafka come to mind) while basing any optimism on a log prefix for which only eventual consistency can be assured.

### My resume and other professional resources
* [Resume.pdf](./justin_c_moore_resume_2020.pdf)
* [Resume.docx](./justin_c_moore_resume_2020.docx)

### My start-up past and future thoughts
* I co-founded Tap.Me, Inc. in 2009 -- it was acquired by MediaMath, Inc. in 2012.
* I do not intend for that to be my last entrepreneurial endeavor...

### My humanity and/or nerdom 
* I love pizza, I like karaoke, and I am committed to weight lifting.
* I prefer electronic music, instrumental music, and soundtracks.
* I am into fictional story-telling in video and audio media (The Adventure Zone, Acquisitions Incorporated, or "Let's Play" videos depending on the game/player).
* I periodically feel the urge to return to game development.
